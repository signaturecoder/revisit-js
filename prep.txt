0. Accept the fact that you have not understood the basics of Javascript. That's why, you are revising it.
1. Learn Event Bubbling - Why we need to give optional value in addEventListner

2. Don't know how to get the input value from input tag and use it in counter function.

3. Avoid using innerHtml to run some Javascript becaue it is more exposed/attacked by Hackers.

4. Learnt the difference between innerHTML, innerText and textContent
innerHTML = returns all the HTML markup including tags, space or styles.
innerText = returns only the text inside an element ( plain text ), without spaces, styeles
textContent = returns text along with styles, 
              "prevent XSS attacks "

Note: Use textContent instead of innerHTML or innerText ( reference : MDN Docs on textContent )
